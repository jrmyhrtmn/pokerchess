        <p className='welcome-text'>PokerChess is a game which combines components of chess and poker. Each player moves a single gamepiece around the board with movement rules corresponding to the chess pieces on the cards in their hand. Each turn, the player chooses a card from their hand to determine their movement rules and then selects one of the highlighted spaces to move their gamepiece to. Every four turns, each player is dealt a new hand of five cards. The game is over when one player moves their piece on top of the opponent's.</p>
